# Foxtana Pro

**Branch `firefox-pre-v3` is a firefox-specific version of [Chrometana Pro](https://github.com/MarcGuiselin/chrometana-pro) since the project's main branch now uses the currently unsupported v3 extension manifest spec and apis. Awaiting mainstream support in firefox before this branch can be dropped in favor of master branch.**
